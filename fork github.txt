Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. 
You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository. For more information, see "Working with forks."

Propose changes to someone else's project
For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fix.
3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.
