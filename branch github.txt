When you create a repository with content on GitHub, GitHub creates the repository with a single branch. 
This first branch in the repository is the default branch. The default branch is the branch that GitHub displays when anyone visits your repository. 
The default branch is also the initial branch that Git checks out locally when someone clones the repository. 
Unless you specify a different branch, the default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits.
